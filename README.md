# Project Portfolio

Advanced CSS Challenge (Module 2): Professional Portfolio

In this project I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be updated over time to become my personal portfolio of work. 
In the example links under 'My Work' I used what I have learned in the first two weeks of the bootcamp about HTML and CSS from scratch. I have added 
few placeholders for future projects which I will update over the time of the bootcamp.

Following are the requirements:

- Portfolio site is divided into few sections, like About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
- Added functional navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections
- Included a link to a PDF of my resume
- Included a recent photo of myself.
- The projects presented in the My Work section include a couple of sample programs I have worked so far on the bootcamp
- The project presented in the My Work will take the user to the deployed application on my GitHub when clicked on.
- Added some placeholder applications that will be added to as I create more applications in the bootcamp
- The page was designed to support multiple screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones
- Included some on hover effects for the various links and the projects on the page

Link to deployed application:
